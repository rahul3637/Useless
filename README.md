✔ **Endless Loading Spinner** – Just keeps spinning… forever.  
✔ **Fake Chatbox** – You can type, but no one will ever respond.  
✔ **Draggable Shapes** – Move them anywhere, but they serve no purpose.  
✔ **Random Useless Wisdom** – Click for 100+ of the most pointless quotes ever.  
✔ **Premium Features!** – Pay to unlock *even more useless things!* 🎉
